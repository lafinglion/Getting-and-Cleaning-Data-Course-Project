# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the project for the Getting and Cleaning course. 

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

1. Download the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory.
2. Read both the training and test datasets.
3. Read the activity and feature info.
4. keep only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation.
5. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset.
6. Merges the two datasets.
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

Code Book codebook.md describes the variables, activity labels shown on Tidy data set tidydata.txt.
